## Ruby is ##

A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

```rb
# Output "I love Ruby"
say = "I love Ruby"
puts say

# Output "I *LOVE* RUBY"
say['love'] = "*love*"
puts say.upcase

# Output "I *love* Ruby"
# five times
5.times { puts say }
```

## About Ruby ##

The Ideals of Rubyâ€™s Creator
Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is "trying to make Ruby natural, not simple," in a way that mirrors life.

Building on this, he adds:

> Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body1.
